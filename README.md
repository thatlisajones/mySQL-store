# mySQL-store

This is a simple, online store built with MySQL and Node.js.

Running bamazonCustomer.js, the app shows the customer a list of products available for purchase. The app prompts the customer to select a product to buy, and to enter the quantity that he or she would like to purchase. If there aren't enough items in stock to meet the customer's order, the customer is notified. Otherwise, the app calculates the cost of the desired purchase. The app updates the database to reflect that a quantity of the purchased item has been sold and is no longer in stock.

Running bamazonManager.js, a store manager can view a list of products. The app allows the manager to see if stock is low, and to add more stock. The app also allows the manager to add additional products for sale.
